    <h1><strong>Types of Internet Security now a days</strong></h1>
    <h2>Active and passive security threats</h2>
    <p>Active and Passive Attacks are security attacks. In Active attack, an attacker tries to modify the content of the messages. Whereas in Passive attack, an attacker observes the messages, copy them and may use them for malicious purposes. ... Passive Attack is dangerous for Confidentiality</p>
  <h3>Active Attack</h3>
  <p>Active attack tries to change the system resources or affect their operation. Passive attack tries to read or make use of information from the system but does not influence system resources. Always causes damage to the system. Do not cause any harm.</p>
   <h3>Passive attack</h3> 
   <p> A passive attack is a network attack in which a system is monitored and sometimes scanned for open ports and vulnerabilities. The purpose is solely to gain information about the target and no data is changed on the target. ... The intruders can then use this information to facilitate covert entry to a network or system.</p>
   <p>An “active threat” is defined as any incident which by its deliberate nature creates an immediate threat or presents an imminent danger to the campus communit</p><br>
   <h2>Types of Malware</h2>
  <h3>Worm</h3>
  <p>A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage</p>
  <p><strong>How do computer worms work?</strong><p>
  <p>Worms can be transmitted via software vulnerabilities. Or computer worms could arrive as attachments in spam emails or instant messages (IMs). Once opened, these files could provide a link to a malicious website or automatically download the computer worm. Once it’s installed, the worm silently goes to work and infects the machine without the user’s knowledge.</p>
  <p>Worms can modify and delete files, and they can even inject additional malicious software onto a computer. Sometimes a computer worm’s purpose is only to make copies of itself over and over — depleting system resources, such as hard drive space or bandwidth, by overloading a shared network. In addition to wreaking havoc on a computer’s resources, worms can also steal data, install a backdoor, and allow a hacker to gain control over a computer and its system settings.</p>
  <h3>Trojan</h3>
    <p> A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.</p>
<p><strong>How to protect against trojans?</strong></p>    
  <p>  By installing effective anti-malware software, you can defend your devices – including PCs, laptops, Macs, tablets and smartphones – against Trojans. A rigorous anti-malware solution – such as Kaspersky Anti-Virus – will detect and prevent Trojan attacks on your PC, while Kaspersky Mobile Security can deliver world-class virus protection for Android smartphones. Kaspersky Lab has anti-malware products that defend the following devices</p>
  <h3>Virus</h3>
    <p>Computer virus, much like a flu virus, is designed to spread from host to host and has the ability to replicate itself. Similarly, in the same way that flu viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming such as a file or document.
In more technical terms, a computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.</p>
<p><strong>How does a computer virus attack?</strong></p>
  <p>  Once a virus has successfully attached to a program, file, or document, the virus will lie dormant until circumstances cause the computer or device to execute its code. In order for a virus to infect your computer, you have to run the infected program, which in turn causes the virus code to be executed.</p>
  <p>This means that a virus can remain dormant on your computer, without showing major signs or symptoms. However, once the virus infects your computer, the virus can infect other computers on the same network. Stealing passwords or data, logging keystrokes, corrupting files, spamming your email contacts, and even taking over your machine are just some of the devastating and irritating things a virus can do.</p>
 <p><strong> How do computer viruses spread?</strong></p>
 <p>In a constantly connected world, you can contract a computer virus in many ways, some more obvious than others. Viruses can be spread through email and text message attachments, Internet file downloads, and social media scam links. Your mobile devices and smartphones can become infected with mobile viruses through shady app downloads. Viruses can hide disguised as attachments of socially shareable content such as funny images, greeting cards, or audio and video files,</p>

  <h3>Spyware</h3>
  <p>Spyware is unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet usage data and sensitive information. Spyware is classified as a type of malware — malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge. Spyware gathers your personal information and relays it to advertisers, data firms, or external users.</p>
  <p>Spyware is used for many purposes. Usually it aims to track and sell your internet usage data, capture your credit card or bank account information, or steal your personal identity. How? Spyware monitors your internet activity, tracking your login and password information, and spying on your sensitive information.</p>
  <p>Some types of spyware can install additional software and change the settings on your device, so it’s important to use secure passwords and keep your devices updated.</p>
  <p><strong>How remove the spyware?</strong></p>
  <p>If you think your device is infected with spyware, run a scan with your current security software to make sure it has cleaned up everything it can. Next, download and run a virus removal tool, such as the free Norton Power Eraser.
There are also other reputable anti-spyware removal tools. Some of them work only when you manually start the scan. Others continuously monitor your computer to make sure spyware can’t modify or monitor your information.</p><br>
<h2>Software and Hardware to protect networks</h2>
<h3>How does network security work?</h3>
<p>Network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources, but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats.</p>
<h3>How do I benefit from network security?</h3>
<p>Digitization has transformed our world. How we live, work, play, and learn have all changed. Every organization that wants to deliver the services that customers and employees demand must protect its network. Network security also helps you protect proprietary information from attack. Ultimately it protects your reputation.</p>
<h2>Network Protocoles</h2>  
  <p>A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Network protocols are the reason you can easily communicate with people all over the world, and thus play a critical role in modern digital communications.</p>
  <p>Similar to the way that speaking the same language simplifies communication between two people, network protocols make it possible for devices to interact with each other because of predetermined rules built into devices’ software and hardware. Neither local area networks (LAN) nor wide area networks (WAN) could function the way they do today without the use of network protocols.</p>
  <h2>Digital Certificates and Certificate Authorities</h2>
  <h3>Digital Certificate</h3>
  <p>A Digital Certificate is an electronic "password" that allows a person, organizaion to exchange data securely over the Internet using the public key infrastructure (PKI). Digital Certificate is also known as a public key certificate or identity certificate.</p>
  <h3>Certificate authorities</h3>
  <p>or Certificate Authorities / CAs, issue Digital Certificates. Digital Certificates are verifiable small data files that contain identity credentials to help websites, people, and devices represent their authentic online identity (authentic because the CA has verified the identity). CAs play a critical role in how the Internet operates and how transparent, trusted transactions can take place online. CAs issue millions of Digital Certificates each year</p>
