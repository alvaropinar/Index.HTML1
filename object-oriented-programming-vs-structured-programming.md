      <h1>Objected-Oriented Programming vs Structured Programming</h1>
      <h2>What is Objected-Oriented Programming</h2>
      <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior.</p>
      <p>OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained.</p>
<p>The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups.</p>
      <p>Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency. Even when using microservices, developers should continue to apply the principles of OOP.</p>
      <h2>What is Structured Programming</h2> 
        <p>Structured programming is a programming paradigm aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs of selection (if/then/else) and repetition (while and for), block structures, and subroutines in contrast to using simple tests and jumps such as the go to statement, which can lead to “spaghetti code” that is potentially difficult to follow and maintain.</p>
      <h2>What is the difference between this 2 types of programming</h2>
        <p>The main difference between structured and object oriented programming is that structured programming allows developing a program using a set of modules or functions, while object oriented programming allows constructing a program using a set of objects and their interactions.</p>
