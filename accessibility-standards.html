    <h1>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h1>
    <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <strong>(WCAG)</strong> are a part of the web accesibility guidelines published by the Web Accessibility Initiative </p>
    <h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 </h2>
    <p>The W3C proyect was the first achivement made by the WCAG. It date backs to the 5th May 1999. The W3C is an international commun ity that includes a full-time 
    The mission of the W3C is to lead the Web to its full potential by developing relevant protocols and guidelines. This is achieved primarily by cratiang and published </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Guideline 1:Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content
        <li> Guideline 2:Do not rely on colour alone
        <li> Guideline 3:Use markup and style sheets, and do so properly
        <li> Guideline 4:Clarify natural language usage
        <li> Guideline 5:Create tables that transform gracefully
        <li> Guideline 6:Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully
        <li> Guideline 7:Ensure user control of time sensitive content changes
        <li> Guideline 8:Ensure direc accesibility of embedded user interfaces
        <li> Guideline 9:Design for device independence
        <li> Guideline 10:User interim solution
        <li> Guideline 11:User W3C technologies and guidelines
        <li> Guideline 12:Provide context and orientation information
        <li> Guideline 13:Provide clear navigation mechanisims
        <li> Guideline 14:Ensure that documents are clear and simple
        </ol>
        <ul>
        <li> <strong> Priority 1 </strong> -  Web developers must satisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be
impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this
level is described as A.
        <li> <strong> Priority 2 </strong> - Web developers should satisfy these requirements, otherwise some
groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is
described as AA or Double-A.
        <li> <strong> Priority 3 </strong> - Web developers may satisfy these requirements to make it easier for
some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described
as AAA or Triple-A.
        </ul>
        <h3>Web Content Accesibility Guidelines 2.0</h3>
        <p>The <strong>WCAG 2.0</strong> was a W3C recommendation published on the 11th December in 2008. It is made by twelve guidelines which follow four principles a
        The W3C's techniques for WCAG 2.0 provides guidance for web content authors and evaluators on meeting WCAG 2.0 success criteria.
    <p><strong>The principles for WCAG 2.0 are:</strong> </p> <br>
    <p><strong>Perceivable</strong> </p> <br>
        <p><strong>Information and user interface components have to be presentable to user in ways they can perceive.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <underline> Guideline 1.1</underline>: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be
changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or
simpler language.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 1.2</underline>:Time-based media: Provide alternatives for time-based media
        <li> <underline> Guideline 1.3</underline>: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example
simpler layout) without losing information or structure.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 1.4</underline>:Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from brackground.
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Operable</strong> </p> <br>
    <p>User interface components and navigation must be operable. </p>
        <ul>
        <li> <underline> Guideline 2.1</underline>:Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 2.2</underline>:Provide users enough time to read and use content.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 2.3</underline>:Do not design content ina way that is known to cause seizures.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 2.4</underline>:Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Understandable</strong> </p> <br>
        <p>Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <underline> Guideline 3.1</underline>:Make text content readable and underestandable
        <li> <underline> Guideline 3.2</underline>:Make web pages appear and operate inpredictable ways.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 3.3</underline>:Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Robust</strong> </p> <br>
        <p>Content must be robust enough so that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technoligies.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <underline> Guideline 4.1</underline>:Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Criticism of <em>WAI</em> guidelines.</p>  
        <p> There has been criticism of the W3C process, claiming that it does not sufficiently put the
        user at the heart of the process. There was a formal objection to WCAG's original claim that
        WCAG 2.0 will address requirements for people with learning disabilities and cognitive
        limitations headed by Lisa Seeman and signed by 40 organisations and people. In articles
        such as "WCAG 2.0: The new W3C guidelines evaluated", "To Hell with WCAG 2.0" and
        "Testability Costs Too Much", the WAI has been criticised for allowing WCAG 1.0 to get
        increasingly out of step with today's technologies and techniques for creating and
        consuming web content, for the slow pace of development of WCAG 2.0, for making the
        new guidelines difficult to navigate and understand, and other argued failings.
        In Spain, UNE 139803 is the norm entrusted to regulate web accessibility. This standard is
        based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. </p>
