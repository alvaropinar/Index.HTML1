        <h3>Web Content Accesibility Guidelines 2.0</h1>
        <p>The <strong>WCAG 2.0</strong> was a W3C recommendation published on the 11th December in 2008. It is made by twelve guidelines which follow four principles a
        The W3C's techniques for WCAG 2.0 provides guidance for web content authors and evaluators on meeting WCAG 2.0 success criteria.
        <p><strong>The principles for WCAG 2.0 are:</strong> <br>
        <p><strong>Perceivable</strong> <br>
        <p><strong>Information and user interface components have to be presentable to user in ways they can perceive.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <underline> Guideline 1.1</underline>:Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need,such as large
        <li> <underline> Guideline 1.2</underline>:Time-based media, provide alternatives for time based media
        <li> <underline> Guideline 1.3</underline>:Create content that can be presented in different ways(for example simpler layout) withot loosing informatin or 
        <li> <underline> Guideline 1.4</underline>:Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from brackground.
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Operable</strong> <br>
        <p>User interface components and navigation must be operable.
        <ul>
        <li> <underline> Guideline 2.1</underline>:Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 2.2</underline>:Provide users enough time to read and use content.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 2.3</underline>:Do not design content ina way that is known to cause seizures.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 2.4</underline>:Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Understandable</strong> <br>
        <p>Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <underline> Guideline 3.1</underline>:Make text content readable and underestandable
        <li> <underline> Guideline 3.2</underline>:Make web pages appear and operate inpredictable ways.
        <li> <underline> Guideline 3.3</underline>:Help users avoid and correct mistakes.
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Robust</strong> <br>
        <p>Content must be robust enough so that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technoligies.</p>
        <ul>
        <li> <underline> Guideline 4.1</underline>:Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
        </ul>
